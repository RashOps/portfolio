**Real-time Market Segmentation Engine using Unsupervised Learning.**

MarketPulse AI is a high-performance market segmentation engine built on unsupervised learning. It automates market data collection (API & Web Scraping), performs advanced feature engineering, and applies a unified **Standardization → PCA → K-Means** pipeline to detect emerging market regimes and strategic asset clusters.

The system is designed for professional environments, featuring strict typing, automated model versioning, and real-time performance monitoring.

### 1. Key Features

- **Automated Ingestion**: Dynamic ticker discovery (S&P 500) and multi-source financial news collection.
- **Unified ML Pipeline**: Encapsulated Scikit-Learn pipeline ensuring strict parity between training and inference.
- **Dynamic Hyper-parameter Tuning**: Automatic selection of the optimal number of clusters ($k$) based on Silhouette scores.
- **Business Intelligence**: Automated cluster profiling and strategic labeling for human-readable insights.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Real-time tracking of ML metrics (explained variance, silhouette) persisted in MongoDB.

---

### 2. Technical Stack

- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (Tooling) & [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/)
- **Package Manager**: [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Fast, reliable dependency management)
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (Pydantic v2)
- **ML / Data Science**: 
  - `scikit-learn` (StandardScaler, PCA, KMeans)
  - `pandas`, `numpy` (Advanced data manipulation)
- **Infrastructure**:
  - **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (Storage of raw data, news, and ML metrics)
  - **Configuration**: `pydantic-settings` (Environment-based centralized config)
- **Scraping**: `BeautifulSoup4`, `httpx`, `yfinance`

### 3. Architecture & Project Structure

The codebase follows a modular architecture aligned with Senior Data Science standards.

```

#### Unified Pipeline Detail
Unlike traditional prototypes, MarketPulse AI uses a single `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` object. This prevents **Data Leakage** by ensuring that the `StandardScaler` and `PCA` parameters used during training are exactly the same during real-time inference.
